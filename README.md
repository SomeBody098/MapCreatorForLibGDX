# MapCreatorForLibGDX

**MapCreatorForLibGDX** is a rather flexible tool for creating game entities in LibGDX using .tmx files. 

To get started, you need to make sure that you have imported the following: 
1) com.badlogicgames.ashley:ashley, 
2) com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-box2d,
3) com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx

**Otherwise, the tool will not work!**
